# payroll-data-manager

## Description 
This project utilizes the programming languages of Javascript to add logic to a webpage crafted using HTML and styled using CSS. This webpage actively updates to reflect changes made within a company's employment database. It allows the user to add new employee information including: first name, last name, and salary, and displays to the user this information in the form of a table. This webpage also returns the average salary across the company, as well as it selects and displays a random employee to the console.
